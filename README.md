# Ecosystem-Simulation-Python
Since about 2020, I would have this recurring interest in creating ecosystem simulations, mostly inspired by [Sebastian Lague's](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague) coding adventure videos. I would get started and the combination of ADHD, life getting busy, various roadblocks, etc., would halt progress and I would would be starting over each time.

I realize that there are a lot of tools or built-in features within Unity, Unreal, or Godot that would probably make a good chunk of this effort trivial, especially now with AI tools and vibe coding. 

But I have always had such a deep desire to learn and figure things out - to really take something apary and learn how it works. That's what I am attempting to do here.
